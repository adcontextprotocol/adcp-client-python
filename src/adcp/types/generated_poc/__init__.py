"""Generated AdCP types - INTERNAL USE ONLY.

WARNING: This module contains auto-generated types that may change without notice.
DO NOT import directly from this module in your code.

These types are implementation details and their structure, naming, and organization
may change between minor versions as schemas evolve. Direct imports from this module
will break your code.

Instead, use the stable public API:
    from adcp.types import BrandManifest, Product, etc.
    from adcp.types.stable import BrandManifest, Product, etc.

The stable API provides consistent naming with proper version guarantees.
