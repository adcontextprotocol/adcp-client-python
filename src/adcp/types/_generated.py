"""INTERNAL: Consolidated generated types.

DO NOT import from this module directly.
Use 'from adcp import Type' or 'from adcp.types.stable import Type' instead.

This module consolidates all generated types from generated_poc/ into a single
namespace for convenience. The leading underscore signals this is private API.

Auto-generated by datamodel-code-generator from JSON schemas.
DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY.
