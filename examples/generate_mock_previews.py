Generate mock preview data for demonstration purposes.

Note: This uses mock data because the reference creative agent at
https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org doesn't currently return
structured format data via MCP (it returns a text message instead).

This demonstrates what the preview URL feature would look like
when connected to a properly implemented ADCP creative agent.
